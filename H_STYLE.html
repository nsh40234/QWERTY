   <h2>Qstn: WHY DO YOU LEARN HTML AND CSS : ZERO TO HERO?</h2>
   <H3>ANS: As a new learner, I would like to give thankyou to letsupgrade for giving this opportunity.
       <br><br>
    a. Fundamental web development languages HTML and CSS are a great way to get started with development.
              <br><br> 
    b. This is because these languages offer simple sets of rules that define how to code and are easy to learn.
              <br><br> 
    c. HTML uses a tag-based structure which is easy to understand even without any prior technical experience.
              <br><br>    
    d. CSS uses a simplistic structure as well making the learning curve for mastery relatively easy.
              <br><br>
    e. Helps you understand and explore other languages and provides you with an opportunity to transition into a different career.
